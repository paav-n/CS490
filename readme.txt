Cheating Policy
Cheating on a programming assignment results in zero credit for all students involved. Cheating on an exam will result in an "F" in the course. 
You may discuss problems with each other, in fact, you are encouraged to do so. Where does discussion end and cheating start? You may NOT copy lines of code from anybody or anywhere. You may NOT use code in your assignments that you did not write. You may not use third party frameworks. As a general rule: If you don't understand the code and can't explain the code, you can't use the code. 
Please familiarize yourself with the NJIT Honor Code. Violations of the honor code will be dealt with seriously and reported immediately to the Dean of Students. 
Late Policy
To receive credit all programming assignments must be handed in on time. No credit will be given for any programming assignment that is not turned in on the day (and time) it is due.
